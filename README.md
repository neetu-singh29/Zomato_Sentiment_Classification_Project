‚úÖ **Project Summary :**
In this Zomato Restaurant Sentiment Classification project, we performed an end-to-end Data Science pipeline involving data wrangling, visualization, hypothesis testing, feature engineering, machine learning modeling, and model deployment readiness. The primary goal of this project was to analyze restaurant reviews and predict customer sentiment (Positive, Neutral, Negative), which can help Zomato and restaurant owners improve services, marketing, and customer experience.

* We used **two** datasets:
1. **Zomato Restaurant Names & Metadata** (contains restaurant-specific information like cost, cuisines, collections, timings, etc.).
2. **Zomato Restaurant Reviews** (contains user reviews, ratings, metadata, time, and more).

üìä **Data Exploration & Preprocessing:**
* First, we merged both datasets on **Restaurant Name**, resulting in a consolidated dataset containing both review text and restaurant-specific metadata.
* Missing values were handled appropriately:
 * **Numerical columns **(e.g., Cost, Ratings, Pictures) filled with **median** values.
 * **Categorical columns** filled with mode or placeholders.
* Outliers in `Cost` were treated using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.
 * **Feature engineering was applied to create new columns like:**
 * **`review_length`**: Number of characters in the review.
 * **`cuisine_count`**: Number of cuisines a restaurant offers.
 * **`Hour`**: Extracted review time hour.
 * **`review_word_count`**: Total words in each review.
* Textual reviews were cleaned using NLP steps including **lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword removal, lemmatization**, and vectorized using **TF-IDF** for ML modeling.

üìà **Visualization & EDA (15+ charts):**

Following **UBM (Univariate, Bivariate, Multivariate)** analysis:

*  **Univariate**: Histograms for cost and review lengths, count plots for cuisine counts.
*  **Bivariate**: Boxplots, violin plots, scatter plots to analyze relationships between cost, ratings, and review length.
*  **Multivariate**: Heatmaps and pairplots to explore feature correlations.
* **Word clouds** generated to highlight frequently used terms in reviews.

* **Insights:**
* Cost and reviews are moderately correlated.
* North Indian and Chinese cuisines dominate.
* High-rated restaurants usually maintain moderate costs.
* Review lengths are longer for higher-cost restaurants, indicating detailed feedback.

**Sentiment Analysis:**

**TextBlob** is used to perform sentiment analysis on customer reviews, categorizing them as **`Positive, Negative, or Neutral`**. This analysis provides a deeper understanding of customer perceptions and overall satisfaction levels.


üîç **Hypothesis Testing:**

We formulated and tested three key business-related hypotheses:

1. High-cost restaurants receive higher ratings.
2. Restaurants with more cuisines tend to receive longer reviews.
3. Rating distribution is independent of the restaurant collections type.

Using **ANOVA and Chi-square tests**, we rejected/accepted hypotheses based on p-values and statistical significance.

‚öôÔ∏è **Feature Selection & Engineering:**
* Important features for modeling: **`Cost_log`, `Rating`, `cuisine_count`, `review_length`, `review_word_count`, `Hour`**.
* Data scaled using **StandardScaler** for optimal model performance.

ü§ñ **Machine Learning Models & Tuning:**

Three models were trained and evaluated:

1. **Logistic Regression (Baseline model)**
* Accuracy: 73.4%
* Precision: 85.2%

2. **Random Forest Classifier (Best Performing Model)**
* Initial Accuracy: 82%, F1-score: 83%
* After tuning (GridSearch): Accuracy improved to 82.6%, F1-score to 83.4%.

3. **SVM (Support Vector Machine)**
* Initial Accuracy: 73.7%
* After tuning: Improved to 74.8%.

üìä **Evaluation Metrics for Business Impact:**
* **Precision:** Ensures correct sentiment identification, important for user satisfaction.
* **Recall:** Ensures no sentiment (especially negative) is missed.
* **F1-Score:** Balanced metric for imbalanced datasets.
* **Accuracy:** Overall correctness of model predictions.

‚úÖ **Final Model & Deployment Readiness:**
* **Random Forest Classifier (Tuned)** selected as final model.
* Saved as **pickle file** for deployment.
* Successfully tested on **unseen data**.
* Ready for real-time prediction deployment via Flask/FastAPI APIs.

üöÄ **Business Value:**
* **Actionable insights** for restaurant owners to improve offerings.
* **Sentiment analysis** helps Zomato tailor personalized recommendations and improve user retention.
* Targeted marketing based on real-time sentiment trends.
